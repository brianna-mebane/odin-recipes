The perfect sweet treats for anyone camping outdoors around an open fire (or glamping from the comfort of their own home!), s'mores are a simple yet inviting recipe elementary enough for even the biggest culinary novices to complete, courtesy of <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/22146/smores/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Allrecipes</a>.</p>
